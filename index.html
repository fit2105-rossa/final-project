                <p class="f4">Overview</p>
                <p>The Cattedrale di San Stefano is the centrepoint of the catholic diocese of Prato.</p>
                <p>In addition to hosting ordinary religious services, the cathedral houses a relic, the ‘Sacred Belt’, and features a prominent external pulpit for the relic's ostentation.[1][2]</p>
                <p>The parish Chiesa di San Stefano was founded in the 6th or 7th century AD.</p>
                <p>The Cathedral in its current form was rebuilt in the 10th century, with a process of renovations and improvements continuously taking place.</p>
                <p>The current facade of green and white marble was created by Lorenzo di Filippo, with works concluding in 1457.</p>

                <p>The Art Centre exists to present, collect, document and promote contemporary art.</p>
                <p>The Centre, originally designed by Italo Gamberini, first opened in 1988, however its renovation under architect Maurice Nio, which added the striking gold coloured extension, was completed in 2016.</p>
                <p>While drastically altering the appearance of the building, unlike the Duomo's purely aesthetic marble facade, this golden extension served both an aesthetic and functional purpose - enveloping the existing building, the 2016 extension doubled the exhibition space available.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The primary materials composing the facade are green and white marble.</p>

                <p>The white stones are ‘alberese’ marble, and the green ‘serpentine’.</p>

                <p>Serpentine marble, also known sometimes as verde di prato, ranges in colours from a very dark bluish black, through to lighter shades of green. The Cathedral and similar buildings primarily used the darker variants, creating bold contrasts.</p>

                <p>White marble has been a frequent feature of high culture, from the greco-roman classical period, to the renaissance, to the mughal empire.</p>

                    <figcaption>Sample of verde di prato from the Medieval Quarries at Monteferrato (Xavier Taylor)</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The use of Serpentine green marble is a frequent motif in the architecture of renaissance Tuscany. (potentially include a few photo examples, inc santa maria novella, castello imperatore etc)</p>

                <p>Renaissance Florentine civilization claimed and celebrated an ideological bond with classical civilization. The use of Serpentine green may have been an architectural expression of this - serpentine green being the analogue in Tuscany’s mountains to green thessaloniki marble.[3][4]</p>

                <p>The serpentine marble seen throughout Tuscany is largely sourced from the monteferrato region to the north west of Prato.</p>

                <p>In particular, serpentine quarries from as far back as the medieval period can still be found in the eastern foothills of Mount Piccioli near Figline, a town 6km to the north of Prato. (show on map, and photos).</p>

                <p class="f4">Quarry Locations</p>

                </div>

                <p>The more common white alberese Marble may have been sourced from Figline or several other locations in the region surrounding Prato and Florence.[5][6]</p>

                <p class="f4">White Alberese Quarry Location</p>
                <p>Marble, whether white or green, is created when carbonate rocks such as limestone undergo metamorphism, whereby heat or pressure change the chemical structure of the rock, while it remains solid.</p>
                <p>In the case of white marble, the limestone is low in silicates.</p>
                <p>In the case of serpentine marble, a combination of magnesium containing silicates gives the rock its greenish hue.[7]</p>
                <p>The marble itself was shaped by hand by craftsmen of the day, whether into simple geometric shapes, or the sculptures and other ornamental details which decorate the facade.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The primary material is a aluminum cladding with a gold finish.</p>

                <p>Bauxite, the primary ore from which aluminium metal is extracted, is mined from the ground before being refined. The refining process produces aluminium oxide, a compound which is then smelted to finally extract pure aluminium metal. From this either bulk rolls of the metal, sheets, or basic products are made.[10][11][12]</p>
 
                <p>Significant bauxite deposits are located in Australia, China, Russia, South Africa, and South America.</p>

                <p>In 1416 Lorenzo Monaco designed a stained glass window for duomo, but the aging and deterioration of this was already evident by its condition within twenty years. Concurrently with the painting of the chapel, that window was replaced with a new one designed by Filippo Lippi and created by the Florentine stained glass painter Fra Lorenzo d'Antonio da Pelago. Due to its large size (44 m²) the window remains one of the chapel's major features and employs horizontal decorative bands of contrasting color for the robes. These decorative details give the glass section greater strength, something that was missing in the first window design.</p>
                <p>This opaque glass provides lighting and a story to be viewed from the inside, whilst providing the same function as privacy tinting in the arts centre from the outside world’s preying eyes.</p>

                <p>The aquamarine colour is created through the use of copper and cobalt compounds, whereas ruby red uses a gold solution as a colouring agent.</p>

                <p>The vertical panels as well as skylights comply with “insulating glass units” as specified in EN 1279-5 as a harmonised European Standard. What this means is that it has minimum thresholds covering and not limited to: Resistance to fire, direct airborne sound insulation, radiation properties relating to light transmittance reflectance and solar energy characteristics. This branding performance is tied to these sheets being ‘Glass6Therm’ which is a grouping used to identify insulation glass.</p>

                <p>Additionally, the majority of the glass at the centre is double glazed, which is better suited to the purposes of maintaining a quiet, reduced moisture and thermally stable environment for housing artwork and functions.</p>

                <p>Whilst the size of Renaissance-Era glass panels were limited by the maximum size that a human worker was able manoeuvre, modern panels have the capability to be significantly larger due automated advancements in glassmaking procedures.</p>

                <p>The size of the glass panels between the two buildings are immediately noticeable. Whilst the glass in the Cathedral consist of a collection of smaller joined-together panels which are high off the ground and provided mainly for lighting purposes, the large clear sections of glass in the Luigi Pecci centre provide a level of interaction. It allows people outside the centre to look clearly inwards at the artwork and events spaces, and also allows the people in the centre to look outwards, for example allowing restaurant-goers to observe the amphitheatre whilst observing their current surrounds as well. This is in direct constrast to the Cathedral, in which the windows create a point of separation between the inside and outside to ensure that they remain distinct.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Terracotta means “baked earth” in Italian, it is a traditionally clay-based ceramic which is used for roofing. Originally designed with a primary emphasis on keeping rain out, it uses a layered tile makeup to insulate the building below.</p>
            
                <p>The terracotta tiles that form the roof of the Cattedrale di San Stefano are composed of clay sourced locally and produced in a kiln somewhere in the Prato locality.</p>

                <p>The roof of the Cattedrale di San Stefano is clearly differentiated from the rest of the structure by a clear colour distinction, as the more muted tones of the green and white marble join the earthy red tones of the terracota. Furthermore, the entirely different tile layering techniques of the roof are noticeably different from the more straightforward stacked-marble facade.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Aluminum roofing is a type of roofing where panels run vertically up the length of the roof and seams are used to connect one panel to its adjacent panel. This type of roofing is different from the traditional roofing methods because it allows allows the roof to create a snug and solid covering which is able to move under thermal expansion.</p>

                <p>The aluminum used in the roofing has undergone anodisation in order to become the golden colour that is visible today. Anodising is an electrochemical conversion process that converts the aluminum metal surface into a porous aluminum oxide, that creates a final product whose finish is more durable and resistant.</p>

                <p>The annodization of the aluminum was completed by <a href="http://euramax.eu">Euramax</a>, a company from the Netherlands.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Whilst the Cattedrale di San Stefano’s roofing follows the more traditional style of a clearly differentiated structure that rests on top of a structure below, the design of the Luigi Pecci centre is happy to blur the line between structural elements and the external facade. The continuous flowing aluminium provides both structure, insulation from the elements and an inviting vista.</p>
